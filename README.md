## Community
I started actively as a community in 2017 with an agile community called Cai√ßara √Ågil in Santos-SP, after some time I wanted to dedicate myself more to the world of backend development and understand if what I went through other people also went through and that's why I started to act more in communities focused on women.
From that I found a Facebook group called Devs Java Girls and asked creator Gleice Ellen if she was willing to turn the group that until then was more of Java logic challenges into a community. From there we started to increase the number of women talking about Java and we started to get to know and create a great support network.
Then I started with the support and mentoring of Otavio Santana to participate and organize SouJava events in S√£o Paulo with Fernando Arruda.
Devs Java Girl votes for JCP and we are an official group as well as SouJava who are also one of the oldest Jugs in the world.
So I'm a member of the SouJava organization and the JavaGirl Devs and I participate as a volunteer in Perifacode and Mulheres na Tecnologia Baixada Santista.
I love mentoring people and exchanging cards, if you can ease your way into the programming area I would be grateful.
I received the Microsoft MVP Award in recognition of what I do in our communities, I don't earn more because of it, it's not a certificate, it's just a way for Microsoft to say thanks for those who contribute so much to the community.
